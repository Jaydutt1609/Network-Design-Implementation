# Scalable Network Design and Implementation

## Project Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a scalable network for MV Limited, connecting four offices located in Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton, and Montreal. The solution supports over 500 devices across all locations while enhancing network efficiency and security.

## Key Features

- **Network Design and Implementation**  
  Designed and implemented a scalable network connecting over 500 devices across four locations.

- **Routing Protocols**  
  Implemented OSPF routing protocol, DHCP failover, and failover clustering for load balancing across dual servers, improving network efficiency by 30%.

- **Security Enhancements**  
  Enhanced security on 200+ routers and switch ports with firewall measures. Established DHCP to manage 1000+ IP addresses.

- **Web and FTP Server Setup**  
  Set up a primary web server for the business website, handling 10,000+ daily visits, and an FTP server for data storage and transfer, managing over 5TB of data.

## Technologies Used

- Networking Protocols: OSPF, DHCP
- Servers: Web Server (IIS), FTP Server
- Security: Firewall configurations
- Data Management: IP address management for 1000+ devices

## Installation

To replicate the network design and implementation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jaydutt1609/Network-Design-Implementation
2. **Setup Networking Equipment**
   - Configure routers and switches with appropriate firewall settings.
   - Implement DHCP and configure IP addresses.
3. **Install Web and FTP Servers**
   - Set up the web server to handle traffic and establish the FTP server for data management.
  
## Usage
 - Use the FTP server for data storage and transfer.
